F,Preview: Sharks at Blackhawks The San Jose Sharks look to put the finishing touches on their successful road trip when they visit the Chicago Blackhawks on Sunday. San Jose had a four-game winless streak when it began its five-game trek at Winnipeg, where the drought reached five after a 5-4 shootout loss. But the Sharks went on to post overtime victories in Calgary and Vancouver before skating to a 3-1 triumph at Edmonton on Friday.
